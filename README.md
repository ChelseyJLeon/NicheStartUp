# NicheStartUp
Continuing with my "Complete 2020 Web Development Bootcamp" course, I made a start-up website for an app idea I have called Niche. Niche uses special algorithms to find your next favorite books based on what story elements you want to see (lesbian supernatural urban fantasy romances, anyone?), what sort of main characters you want (BIPOC and lesbian, please), what sort of mood you are in (more happy endings, thanks), and so much more. Maybe one day I will make such an application for real, but for now, here's the website for it that I made using Bootstrap and the usual suspects. Enjoy!
